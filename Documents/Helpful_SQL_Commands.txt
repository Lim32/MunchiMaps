Once on the Glitch Terminal:

To begin executing SQL commands first type:

    $ sqlite3 database_file.db 

To See Tables (name only):

    sqlite> .tables 

To See Table (with all fields):

    sqlite> .schema table_name 

To See Table (with all columns):

    sqlite> SELECT * FROM table_name;

To Drop a Table (This deletes EVERYTHING including the initialization):

    sqlite> DROP TABLE table_name;
